Traffic engineering is an important field in urban design. Cities plan roads to make the flow of traffic as smooth and safe as possible. Since there are many possible strategies and rules that could be implemented, we can use modeling and simulation to compare the strategies to see which one works best.

Please see the Jupyter notebook and the corresponding paper with my findings for more details.
